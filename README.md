# SimpleLightController
This is a simple "Light" controller that has a device with 3 potentiometers(for red, green, blue settings) connected to the PC, that communicates over UART > RS485 > UART > USB to this application.
The values from pots are then used to set the red, green and blue values on screen, as well as the combined color in one.
This is just a simple exercise program for me and my partner to learn protocols and CRC calculating.

If this is of some use, feel free to use.
Thanks for stopping by!
